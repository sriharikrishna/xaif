  General Information:
  The xaif schema is intended for an xml base 
  intermediate representation of numerical programs. 
  Its scope is reduced to represent the numerical 
  kernel of the programs as relevant to a semantic 
  transformation of the numerical computations. 
  It is part of the OpenAD framework.
  The main application is automatic
  differentiation, i.e. the generation of code for
  the computation of derivatives.
  The following people are the principal authors of the
  current version:
    Uwe Naumann
    Boyana Norris
    Jean Utke
